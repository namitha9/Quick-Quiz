Name of Application
    Quick Quiz

Brief Description
    An application that ultimately tests the user's knowledge and skills. It gives the user the freedom to pick a topic of their choice, and poses questions for the user to answer. If the user answer answers correctly, the user is awarded a point. This simple quiz calculates the number of points achieved along with the number of questions answered. It makes the use of an API to retrieve the question and check the answer for the option selected.

Challenges Faced and Learning Moments
1. One of the biggest challenges I faced was implemented providers when using Stateful Widgets. I had initially implemented the Stateful Widget to help change the state. Additionally, I wanted to use StateProviders in the class, but was clueless on how to implement this. I researched about the use, and after many iterations I had learnt about ConsumerStatefulWidget, which helps use StateProviders when the class is Stateful.
2. Another challenge I faced was the implementation of responsive widgets. This includes creating different layouts for different sizes of the screen. My initial plan was to create different classes for each layout. But this plan is time-consuming, as I would have to create layouts for all three pages included. Further down the line, after much thought, I had implemented simple if statements inside the build function, hence making the workload lighter.
3. A small challenge I encountered was the design of the application. To enhance the design, I added some SizedBox widgets along the program. This aided with how the application looks. Moreover, I changed some of the colors and grouped objects to show their similarity.
